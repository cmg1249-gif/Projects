# Connor's Cybersecurity & Python Projects

Welcome to my repository! This is a collection of my hands-on work in cybersecurity, networking, Python programming, Linux administration, and embedded systems. Everything here reflects my ongoing learning journey as I work toward a career in cybersecurity and digital forensics.

I created this repository to document my progress, share my projects, and demonstrate the skills I’m building through coursework, self-directed study, and daily practice.
